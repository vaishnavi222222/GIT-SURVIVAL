# 🛠️ Git Survival – My Git & GitHub Practice Repo

Welcome to **Git Survival** – a personal repository where I’ve documented my hands-on practice with **Git** and **GitHub**!  
This repo contains commands, examples, and small test projects I used to understand how Git works, how version control helps in development, and how to collaborate using GitHub.

## 📘 About This Repo

This repository serves as:
- A reference for commonly used Git commands
- A step-by-step journey of how I learned and practiced Git
- A place to keep my trial/test files while exploring version control
